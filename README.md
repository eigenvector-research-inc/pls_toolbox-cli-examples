# PLS_Toolbox CLI Examples

This repository contains **MATLAB code examples** demonstrating how to use the [**PLS_Toolbox**](https://eigenvector.com/software/pls-toolbox/) from the **command line interface (CLI)** rather than the graphical user interface (GUI).

These examples are intended to help users automate common chemometric workflows, integrate PLS_Toolbox models into custom scripts, and explore scripting capabilities for process analytics, spectroscopy, and multivariate modeling.

---

## Overview

The **PLS_Toolbox CLI** provides full access to modeling, preprocessing, validation, and prediction tools directly from MATLAB scripts or the command window.  
This repository illustrates example of:
- How to load and preprocess data sets programmatically  
- How to build and validate models (e.g., PCA, PLS, PLS-DA, PCR, etc.)  
- How to export and reuse models  
- How to perform predictions from the command line  
- How to script diviner from the command line
- Any script that showcases applications of the PLS_Toolbox  

Each example is self-contained and includes explanatory comments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **MATLAB R2020b or later**
- **PLS_Toolbox v9.0+** (or compatible Eigenvector version)
- Optional: **Eigenvector Solo+MIA** for standalone deployment examples

Make sure the PLS_Toolbox is correctly installed and licensed before running the scripts.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Clone the repository and add it to your MATLAB path:

```matlab
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pls_toolbox-cli-examples.git
addpath(genpath('pls_toolbox-cli-examples'));

Then run an example, for instance:

run('examples/pls_regression.m')

Each script contains detailed comments explaining the CLI syntax, required inputs, and key parameters.
